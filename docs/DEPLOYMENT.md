# Deployment Guide

## Prerequisites

### Required Software
- Node.js (v18.0.0 or higher)
- npm (v9.0.0 or higher)
- Git

### Environment Setup
- Access to deployment platform (Vercel/Netlify/etc.)
- Environment variables configuration
- Database access (if applicable)

## Local Development

1. **Clone and Install**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
npm install
```

2. **Environment Configuration**
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
- Configure environment variables:
  ```
  VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
  VITE_ENV=development
  ```

3. **Run Development Server**
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Production Deployment

### Building the Application

1. **Create Production Build**
```bash
npm run build
```

2. **Test Production Build Locally**
```bash
npm run preview
```

### Deployment Platforms

#### Vercel Deployment
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Configure build settings:
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `dist`
   - Install Command: `npm install`
3. Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard
4. Deploy

#### Netlify Deployment
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify
2. Configure build settings:
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Publish Directory: `dist`
3. Set environment variables in Netlify dashboard
4. Deploy

### Post-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Verify all environment variables are set
- [ ] Test all main functionalities
- [ ] Check mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Verify API connections
- [ ] Test error handling
- [ ] Monitor performance metrics

## Continuous Integration/Deployment (CI/CD)

### GitHub Actions Workflow

```yaml
name: CI/CD

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
      - name: Build
        run: npm run build
```

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Performance Monitoring
- Use Lighthouse for performance metrics
- Monitor Core Web Vitals
- Track error rates and user interactions

### Regular Maintenance
- Weekly dependency updates
- Monthly security audits
- Regular backup checks
- Performance optimization reviews

## Troubleshooting

Common deployment issues and solutions:

1. **Build Failures**
   - Check Node.js version compatibility
   - Verify all dependencies are installed
   - Review build logs for errors

2. **Environment Variables**
   - Confirm all required variables are set
   - Check for correct variable naming
   - Verify variable accessibility

3. **API Connection Issues**
   - Verify API endpoint configurations
   - Check CORS settings
   - Confirm API key validity

## Rollback Procedures

In case of deployment issues:

1. Identify the last stable version
2. Trigger rollback in deployment platform
3. Verify system stability
4. Investigate root cause
