# Challenge 1: The Perfect Setup

This project is a starter file for React-based projects. The goal of this project is to provide a standard structure with all the conventions, documentation, and tools required for a successful React project. Here I made a basic To do app as example code.

## Project Structure

### File and Folder Organization

- **/src**: Contains all the source code of the application.
  - **/assets/**: Static files (images, fonts, etc.).
  - **/components/**: Reusable components.
    - **/layout/**: Layout-related components (e.g., Header, Footer).
    - **/tasks/**: Task-specific components (e.g., TaskItem, TaskList).
  - **/pages/**: Page components (e.g., TodoPage).
  - **/hooks/**: Custom hooks for shared logic (e.g., `useTaskFilter`).
  - **/context/**: React Context for managing global state (e.g., TaskContext).
  - **/styles/**: Tailwind and additional CSS files.
  - **/utils/**: Utility functions for shared logic.

**Example Folder Structure:**

```bash
src/
├── assets/            # Images, fonts, and other static files

│   ├── App.css
│   └── index.css
├── App.jsx            # Main app component
